# tl_uiSearchConverter(for Linux OS)
Description:

This is the UI: 
-the user searches and selects only .ui file from which he wants to create .py file
-the user selects where he wants the .py file to be saved: same or parent folder as the original .ui file
-the user presses the command to execute the creation of .py file


How It Works:
1)Download the files and place them in one place:
For Example the Path where all files is: /home/explosiveprogrammers/Dev/tl_uiSearchConverter

2)Go to the shell and set the working directory to the Path:
For Example run the command in the shell: cd /home/explosiveprogrammers/Dev/tl_uiSearchConverter

3)Run the uiSearchConverter.py with your python interpreter:
For Example run the command in the shell: python3 uiSearchConverter.py
